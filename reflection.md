- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It kind of comes across to me as a type of accessing that just takes a lot more information so that connect your classes more easily.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was using my resources so I know that I'm using the right syntax, which was the biggest problem I ran into.
